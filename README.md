# ðŸ“š Off Library

This program has been carefully developed with the primary purpose of storing and cataloguing comprehensive information about books, going far beyond simply listing titles.

## About
The OFF Library is a remarkable case study project. 

One of the distinctive features of this project is its integration with a high-performance local database. This allows users to record meticulous details about their books, such as title, author, publisher, publication date, synopsis and many other essential elements in an efficient and organised manner.

This software is highly effective for managing libraries, both personal and institutional. With OFF Library, you can not only catalogue your book collection, but also add personal notes, assign ratings, all in an intuitive and user-friendly user interface.
